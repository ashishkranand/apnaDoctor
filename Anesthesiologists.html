            An anesthesiologist is a doctor who gives a patient medication so they do not feel pain when they are undergoing surgery.
          </p>
          <p class="smallPara">
            However, these specialist physicians play a much wider role than just putting people to sleep for surgery.<br>

            They are also involved in a range of other medical procedures, including carrying out assessments in critical care units, dealing with emergency situations, and giving advice about pain management.

          <p class="smallPara">
            Anesthesiology is defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists as: “The practice of medicine dedicated to the relief of pain and total care of the surgical patient before, during and after surgery.”<br><br>
            Anesthesiologists are involved in around 90 percent of the more than 40 million surgical procedures that are carried out under anesthetic each year in the United States.<br><br>
            This involvement may include direct care of the patient or supervision of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) or Anesthesia Assistants, who also play a key role in the field.<br><br>

              <p class="smallPara">
                The anesthesiologist also plays a key role in critical care and treatment and trauma. They assess patients, make diagnoses, provide support for breathing and circulation, and help to ensure that infection is prevented.<br><br>
                Anesthesiologists are also qualified to contribute to emergency medicine, providing airway and cardiac resuscitation and support and advanced life support, as well as pain control. They help stabilize patients and prepare them for surgery.<br><br>
                Some anesthesiologists will seek additional training and qualifications to specialize in pain medicine and critical care.<br><br>

                    Every anesthesiologist is trained to support surgical intervention, but many also specialize in particular areas.<br><br>
                    These include:<br><br>

                  <p class="smallPara">
                    An anesthesiologist who specializes in pain medicine may assist patients who have pain due to a range of causes, including headaches, burns, diabetes and herpes, or where they are experiencing chest pain, abdominal, pain pelvic pain, and so on.<br><br>
